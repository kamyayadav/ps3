    "# Week 11: Data Visualization and Bivariate Regression (Solutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will focus on visualizing relationships between two variables and then running regressions to see those relationships in numbers. Learning how to visualize data well is a very important skill - more often than not, you will present data analysis results to lay audiences who do not have the expertise to interpret numbers the way you do and plots are the best way to convey important results. \n",
    "\n",
    "The package we use in R to create plots is called `ggplot2` and it is a versatile package for making many different types of plots. The one we focus on is called a scatterplot and we add lines of best fit to it. You have already seen other types of plots in previous lectures that can also be created in `ggplot` such as histograms. "
