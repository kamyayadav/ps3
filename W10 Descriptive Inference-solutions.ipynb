    "# Week 10: Descriptive Inference (Solutions)\n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will focus on using the `difference_in_means()` function to conduct descriptive inference. We will use the CCES survey data from after the 2020 election. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a reminder, this is what the variables mean: \n",
    "\n",
    "- `vvweight_post`: Survey weight\n",
    "- `person_of_color`: `1` if person identifies as a person of color; `0` if person identifies as non-Hispanic white\n",
    "- `college`: `1` if the person graduated from college; `0` if the person did not\n",
    "- `female`: `1` if the person identifies as female; `0` otherwise\n",
    "- `medicare_expand`: `1` if the person favors expanding Medicare; `0` otherwise\n",
    "- `vote_wait`: How long someone said they had to wait to vote. Rounded to 0, 5, 15, 45, or 90 minutes. `NA` means missing (question was not asked), `difference_in_means()` will ignore these cases.\n",
    "- `votereg_problem`: Encountered a problem when they tried to vote (e.g., ID was rejected, didn't appear on voter registration list); `0` = no; `1` = yes"
