    "# W12: Multivariate Regression \n",
    "\n",
    "This week we will focus on two uses of multivariate regression: observational analysis and experimental analysis. We will use a dataset from a study I recently conducted on peer-to-peer correction of online misinformation (Yadav and Xu, working paper). \n",
    "\n",
    "The study looked at whether we can use social norm nudges to increase peer to peer correction of online misinformation. There were two types of nudges used - one that emphasized the acceptability of correction and one that emphasized the user responsibility of correction. In the experiment, respondents were assigned to one of three treatment conditions: a control with no nudge, an acceptability nudge, or a responsibility nudge. These nudges were embedded on social media posts that had misinformation about climate change or microwaving a penny. We additionally collected covariates on gender, age, race, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a reduced set of covariates from the experimental data. Some details about these covariates are included below: \n",
    "- `age`: Age of the respondent (numeric variable)\n",
    "- `gender`: Gender of the respondent (Male, Female)\n",
    "- `employment`: 1 if the respondent is employed and 0 if they are not (binary variable)\n",
    "- `marital_status`: 1 if the respondent is married and 0 if not (binary variable)\n",
    "- `treatment`: the variable for which treatment condition the respondent was assigned to\n",
    "    - \"control\": assigned to social media posts that have no nudges\n",
    "    - \"acceptability\": assigned to social media posts that have the acceptability nudge\n",
    "    - \"responsibility\": assigned to social media posts that have the responsibility nudge\n",
    "- `correction`: the outcome variable that is 1 if the respondent corrected at least one of the social media posts and 0 if they corrected neither.\n"
