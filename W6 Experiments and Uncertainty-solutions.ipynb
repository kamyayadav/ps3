    "This week we are going to get more practice using the difference in means function from last week and get an introduction to the standard error and t-statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the lobbyist data from this week. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into the code, here are some of the important concepts of the week: \n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Average Treatment Effect**: If we could see all the potential outcomes, the actual truth about what the causal effect of a treatment is.\n",
    "- **Estimate**: From a particular study run a particular time, our best guess of what the true average treatment effect is.\n",
    "- **Bias**: When a study's estimates are systematically wrong in a particular direction; e.g., because of omitted variable bias. Observational studies typically are biased. Experiments have no bias. If a study design is biased, it would be wrong even if its sample size were infinitely large.\n",
    "- **Noise**: Because of random chance, a study's estimate differs from the truth, even though it is on average correct. If a study had an infinitely large sample size, it would have no noise. Experiments can also have noise. \n",
    "- **Standard Error**: A way of measuring *how much* a study's estimate will differ from the truth (and between different runs of the same experiment) because of random chance. I.e., a measure of how much noise there is in an experiment.\n",
    "- **t-statistic**: Defined as the estimate divided by the standard error. Gives an indication of how likely a study's result is to have arisen by chance. (More soon on how to use this.)"

    "- `ally`: The authors thought that social lobbying might be especially effective among legislators who had supported the group's priorities in the past. To measure this, they asked the lobbyist: \"In your opinion, how well does the phrase ‘ally of the interest group’ describe the legislator?\" This is therefore the lobbyists' rating of whether the legislator is an ally of the interest group (values 0, 1/3, 2/3, and 1).\n",
